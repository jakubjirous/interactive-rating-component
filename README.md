## 🎯 My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) – JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) – React framework
- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) – For styles

### What I learned

In this code challenge, I learned how to work with Chakra UI, a React component library that provides pre-styled UI components. I gained an understanding of its concepts, such as components, styles, and themes. 

The main takeaway for me was learning how to create a foundation for larger scale projects using Chakra UI as a starter point, particularly when using custom theming. This knowledge will be valuable for future projects as I can use Chakra UI to efficiently create UIs, and focus more on the functional aspects of my application.
